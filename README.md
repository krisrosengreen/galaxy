# Simulation of two galaxies colliding using Newtonian mechanics

There is mutual attraction between all objects, therefore the time complexity fo the force-calculations run is O(n^2). However, the system could run in O(nm) time if the barycenter was used to calculated attraction between stars and center of galaxy.
